# snakemake-RNA-Seq
Intended as a snakemake pipeline for general RNA-Seq analysis. Work in progress.
RNA-Seq data I am working with originates from Edinburgh Genomics sequencing facilities. 
Since they preform read adapter trimming and initial QC, these steps will not be included in the pipline at this time.
Pipeline is not yet functional.
